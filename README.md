# Apex Guide

### Overview
Subnet 1 Apex subnet drives algorithmic innovation across diverse problem domains. Each pursuit of the best solution takes place within a **Competition**, which consists of multiple **Rounds** of evaluation where participants (miners) submit their Python-based algorithms through the Apex CLI and earn rewards based on their performance. Validators continuously evaluate these submissions, scoring them against benchmarks and  distributing blockchain-based rewards to miners whose solutions perform best, creating a trustless incentive mechanism that encourages innovation and optimization across various computational challenges.
