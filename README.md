# Apex Guide

### [Overview](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex)
Subnet 1 Apex subnet drives algorithmic innovation across diverse problem domains. Each pursuit of the best solution takes place within a **Competition**, which consists of multiple **Rounds** of evaluation where participants (miners) submit their Python-based algorithms through the Apex CLI and earn rewards based on their performance. Validators continuously evaluate these submissions, scoring them against benchmarks and  distributing blockchain-based rewards to miners whose solutions perform best, creating a trustless incentive mechanism that encourages innovation and optimization across various computational challenges.

### [Miner Docs](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup)

See miner docs for an overview on the [Apex CLI](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup/apex-cli) and [incentive mechanism](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/incentive-mechanism). 

### [Validator Docs](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/validating)

See validator docs for an overview on validator setup. 

### [Current Competitions](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup/current-competitions)

**[Matrix Compression V1: Lossless Compression](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/new-subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup/current-competitions)**: A lossless compression competition exploring how small neural activations, both forward and backward, can be compressed while still retaining all their original information.

**[RL Battleship](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-current-competitions#id-3.-reinforcement-learning-battleship)**: A strategy game competition in which miners compete to sink ships on a 10x10 grid in as few turns as possible, now with reinforcement learning. Miners train and submit models that compete in the game environment.

**[Matrix Compression V2: Lossy Compression](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-current-competitions#compression-of-activations-challenge-1)**: A lossy compression challenge focused on reducing bfloat16 matrices while preserving enough information for effective training, allowing minor loss.
